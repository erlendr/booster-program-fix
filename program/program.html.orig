            <span class="parts">
        </span>
          </h5>
          <span class='author'>Oliver Zeigermann and Julia Dellnitz</span>
          
          <div class='description'><div>Andrej Karpathy, Director of AI at Tesla, coined the term software</div>
<div>2.0. He envisions machine learning to become an integrated part of the</div>
<div>the software development cycle, partially replacing traditional</div>
<div>approaches to software development. Following that approach developers</div>
<div>and all the people interested in software development can benefit from</div>
<div>understanding the basis of machine learning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In this workshop we will introduce you to machine learning leaving out</div>
<div>most of the math. Some exercises will require a laptop or tablet with</div>
<div>Internet access, some will just be on paper. We will also</div>
<div>present you with some scenarios from real businesses that show you</div>
<div>where and how to apply machine learning. You will learn about the</div>
<div>basic ideas of machine learning what deep learning is all about.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Previous Knowledge: just interest in the basic ideas of machine learning</div>
<div>Requirements: laptop or tablet are advisable</div>
<div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" />Target audience: everyone</div>
<div>Objective: You understand how machine learning works, in what areas it</div>
<div>can be more powerful than traditional programming and get some</div>
<div>inspiration where you could use it</div></div>

          <h5>Creating technology-agnostic styleguides with Pattern Lab
            <span class="parts">

          </h5>
          <span class='author'>Gry Nagel and Eivind Mjelde</span>
          
          <div class='description'><p class="p1">One of the more challenging aspects of being a front-end developer is knowing how to split up a design into reusable components. Too often you end up writing redundant code because you did not realise that a similar component had already been made within the project, or because you failed to realise that two components could be built upon the same foundation.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Creating a front-end pattern library (commonly also referred to as style guide, UI library, component library, design system etc.) is one measure we can take to organise the implementation of a design, and help keep our code as DRY as possible by embracing a more modular way to interpret a design.</p>

<p class="p1">Pattern Lab (<a href="http://patternlab.io/"><span class="s1">http://patternlab.io/</span></a>) is a framework for creating pattern libraries built upon the concept of atomic design methodology (<a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/"><span class="s1">http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/</span></a>). This (relatively) technology-agnostic framework allows you to quickly set up a system to easily organise, edit, document and share your project&rsquo;s design patterns. Pattern Lab has also become quite extensible, allowing developers to create plugins, theming and setups to customise the look and functionality of the existing framework.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">This workshop will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Quick introduction to the concepts behind atomic design in relation to the Pattern Lab framework</li>
<li class="li1">Setting up and configuring Pattern Lab using Node and Gulp.</li>
<li class="li1">Going through a couple of exercises showing how to define, use and modify patterns (design components) to mock up finished page templates for a website.</li>

<div>approaches to software development. Following that approach developers</div>
<div>and all the people interested in software development can benefit from</div>
<div>understanding the basis of machine learning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In this workshop we will introduce you to machine learning leaving out</div>
<div>most of the math. Some exercises will require a laptop or tablet with</div>
<div>Internet access, some will just be on paper. We will also</div>
<div>present you with some scenarios from real businesses that show you</div>
<div>where and how to apply machine learning. You will learn about the</div>
<div>basic ideas of machine learning what deep learning is all about.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Previous Knowledge: just interest in the basic ideas of machine learning</div>
<div>Requirements: laptop or tablet are advisable</div>

<div>Objective: You understand how machine learning works, in what areas it</div>
<div>can be more powerful than traditional programming and get some</div>
<div>inspiration where you could use it</div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ll then work together to figure out what could be done differently to move from a disempowered organisation to an empowered one.</span></p>

          <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation requires teamwork. Agile requires teamwork. Not any kind of teamwork, but rather excellent, intelligent teamwork. In this workshop we will have a closer look at what it takes to create really powerful, great teams of individuals. The idea is to look at a team (can be a couple, a Scrum team, a leadership team, an organisation) as a system. The key lies in the relationships between people. The powerful concept called Relationship Systems Intelligence (RSI) goes beyond Emotional and Social Intelligence and insist that the team itself is an entity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tools we will use are to a large extent coming from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.crrglobal.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRR Global</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will explore concepts like &ldquo;Designing Team Alliance&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Team Entity&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Voice of the System&rdquo;, &ldquo;Deep Democracy&rdquo; etc. The main reference is </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Intelligent-Teams-Relationship-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B018GWJJ14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Intelligent Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Anne R&oslash;d and Marita Fridjhon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile leadership requires great teamwork, and it is due time to dig deeper into this. What does teamwork mean, and which tools can help us getting better at it? </span></p></div>

<p>The goal of this talk is to reconsider what code looks like, and why programmers&rsquo; tools seem stuck in the 1970s.&nbsp;This talk first explores how layout and typography can make code beautiful, and then considers the disruptive potential of visual programming.&nbsp;The most important impact of both trends turns out to be code readability.&nbsp;After all, as Knuth pointed out, &lsquo;Programs are meant to be read by humans, and only incidentally for computers to execute.&rsquo;</p>

This was followed by another Proof of Concept in the summer of 2017 in which we aimed to automatically detect former residents of Norway who had emigrated without notifying the government. In this talk we will present the knowledge and experiences we gained from these Proofs of Concept. How do you organize the development of a Machine Learning PoC? How does the development process for a Machine Learning application differ from that of an ordinary enterprise application?

<p>So now that everyone and their dog is agile, what really changed? Are we really &bdquo;delivering more value in less time&ldquo; as many agile methodologies promise. What do we even mean by value? How do we know when we&rsquo;ve delivered value? When we&rsquo;re "done" according to our "Definition of Done", or when we can validate that a feature is being used by our customers?</p>
<p>Most organizations that implement agile methodologies mistakenly believe that implementing the process according to spec is the goal. In reality it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many certifications you have if the product you are building does not meet end users expectations.</p>
<p>I will talk about:</p>

<li>Why every organization tries to be a factory, and why it is a bad model for software development.</li>

          <span class='author'>Hans Kristian Flaatten</span>
          
          <div class='description'><p>Rewind back to the beginning of autumn of 2016. The Directorate of Fisheries, headquartered here in Bergen, faced several growing pains. The ever demanding changes from new fishing and aquaculture regulations, two large IT-projects by outside consultants, and personnel changes within the IT department had definitely taken it's toll on the situation.</p>
<p>The directorate was a traditional Java Enterprise with a large monolithic Oracle database in the center of it all. Several generations of Java applications had accumulated over the years. All of them had their own hand-crafted runtime environment and deployment procedures. Automated build and deployments was not common practice up until this point, and as a result deployments were error prone, and far apart.</p>
<p>Shortly after I arrived, a DevOps task force was assembled and we started working our way to the root cause, and we discovered three major concerns we wanted to tackle;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>move away from manual builds and deployment by automating everything</li>
<li>reduce the number of different runtime-environments and simplify deployments</li>
<li>introduce higher level of monitoring and insight into the applications</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal was simple; <em>push - build - deploy</em>. We wanted the best possible developer experience and simplicity and insight for the operational personnel.</p>
<p>We quickly established that containers was the best way forward and would give us much needed headroom in the future for taking on new technologies, and that Kubernetes was the best fit for the job. It would also allow us to move into the cloud easily when that would come.</p>
<p>This task would not be easy moving about a hundred different services across multiple generations of Java-code onto one common platform. We certainly had our difficulties and setbacks where we had to start over but by the time we reached the summer our first application on the new platform went into production, and shortly there after several more.</p>
<p>Now, a little over one year in we are almost a 100% done with the first transition phase, and we will at that point reach&nbsp;400 container running at any given time in our two clusters. This is the story of how we made this transformation to a Cloud Native First Architecture on Kubernetes happen, what lessons we have learned along the way, and&nbsp;some thought on where we want to go next.</p></div>

          <span class='author'>Einar Høst</span>
          
          <div class='description'><p>This workshop is based on the classic 1982 paper "Functional Geometry" by Peter Henderson. The paper shows the decomposition and reconstruction of Escher's woodcutting "Square Limit", a beautiful recursive tesselation of interleaving fish, using functional programming. We will use Elm as our implementation language as we follow in Henderson's footsteps to create our own Square Limit as an SVG. We'll see that framing a problem in the right way enables us to solve it in interesting and elegant ways. The problem in this case is the transformation and combination of pictures to form new and more complex pictures. If we think of an picture not as a collection of colored pixels but rather as a function from a bounding rectangle to a rendering, we can define simple yet powerful picture combinators that allow us accomplish our task with ease and elegance.</p>

<p>Many of us have switched from JavaScript to TypeScript as our language for daily project work. TypeScript improves JavaScript by adding types and a compiler, which by itself can significantly reduce the amount of bugs in your code. But we can do better: by using the type system actively, the compiler goes from being a simple type checker to a mighty coding assistant.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will explore the possibilities of the TypeScript type system, and how we can actively use it to write correct, bug-free code. We will use interfaces and union types to precisely define our objects, making impossible states impossible. These techniques will save us from writing a lot of tests, and will enable the compiler to guide us towards the correct solution. We will also explore how to configure the TypeScript compiler to catch as many bugs as possible at compile-time.</p>
<p>After this workshop you will no longer think of the compiler as a stumbling block, but rather as a tool that helps you produce high quality code.</p></div>
